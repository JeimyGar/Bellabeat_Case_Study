Bellabeat data: The primary datasets used for this analysis are the "Firbit Fitness Tracker Data" from Kaggle that can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit). This dataset was generated between 03.12.2016 and 05.12.2016 and included minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monotoring for 30 individials. There were some limitations to this data as we did not know the age or gender of any of these participants. All 30 participants also did not submit their information in all categories and for all of the days of the dataset.
